# Next.js Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js Link component. The problem involves links not functioning correctly, failing to navigate to the intended pages. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem Description

The initial code uses the Next.js `Link` component to create links to the home and about pages.  However, clicking these links does not properly navigate the user. This could be due to various reasons, including incorrect href values, missing or improperly configured routing, or conflicts with other code.

## Solution

The solution involves reviewing the code for errors in the `href` attribute and ensuring the appropriate pages exist and are correctly defined within the Next.js application's routing structure. The `bugSolution.js` file offers a possible corrected version of the code.

This example serves as a guide for debugging similar issues. Please ensure that you have correctly configured your Next.js application and that the paths specified in the `href` attribute are accurate.
